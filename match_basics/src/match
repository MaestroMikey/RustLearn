Match expressions:
Add logic to program.

Similar to if..else

Match functions must be exhaustive, meaning all options must be accounted for.]

Match will be checked by the compiler.
    If a new possibility is added, you will be notified when this occurs.

Else..if is not checked by the compiler. Meaning once it finds the first condition, it will stop running.
    If a new possibility is added, your code may contain a bag.

Preferred when working with a single variable.

Considers all possibilities.
    More robust  code.

'_' to signify matching with "anything else".  A condition or variable not listed in the match body.
